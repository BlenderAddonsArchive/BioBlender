BioBlender is an addon for Blender, aimed at providing tools for the import and elaboration of biological molecules.
It consists of several functions, some executed by Blender and/or its Game Engine, and some others performed by external programs, such as PyMOL, APBS etc.

It was developed by the Scientific Visualization Unit of the Institute of Cliniclal Physiology of the CNR of Italy in Pisa, with the contribution of several colleagues.

We have now made it an Open Project, with the intent of keeping it updated, as long as Blender keeps moving on, and of possibly introducing new, better and useful features. 

More info can be found on the SciVis website (www.scivis.it) and on BioBlender.eu 

BioBlender was developed to work on Windows, Mac and Linux. Therefore each fix will need to be tested on each of these platforms.
Also, as BioBlender is supposed to handle different types of molecules, we will test:

  - Single protein, multiple conformations File: "01_CaM_protein3conformations.pdb";
  - Double strand DNA fragment  File  "02_4IHV_dsDNA.pdb";
  - Glycoprotein (protein with sugar-like molcule attached) file "05_glycoprotein_4AY9_FSH.pdb";
  - Small protein for testing GE. File "06_1L2Y_4GE.pdb";
  - Composite protein (dimer), file: "04_Dimer_1A4U.pdb";
  - Interacting protein/DNA, file "03_3IV5_ProteinComplex.pdb".

The SciVis Team is grateful to all that will contribute to this project.
